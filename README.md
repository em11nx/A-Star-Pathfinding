# A-Star-Pathfinding
Just a pathing finding bot with randomly generated rooms

P - Test new path | 
M - Make a random map | 
The red ball is the player and the blue ball is the goal | 
Both balls can be dragged around | 
White cells - walls | 
Black cells - floor


#disclaimer
Not all code was writen by me only the function "std::list<int> Map::astar(int start, int end)" in map.cpp was writen by me.
